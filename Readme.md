# Perception in Robotics

> This repository is a cumilation of 4 ROS based Robotics Perception project that I have completed.

- My Initials in ROS

    It involved making a turtlesim to write my initials, i.e., E.G., in ROS.
    
- Camera Model and Stereo Depth Sensing
    
    This mini-project focused on camera models, calibrating multiple view geometry, stereo calibration and rectification, sparse depth triangulation and dense depth triangulation.

- Camera Motion and Structure

    It consisted of calibrating Planar homeography, camera pose estimation from a single view and camera pose estimation and reconstruction from two different views.

- Pursuit Evasion Game

    It uses SLAM using the gmapping package in ROS to create maps of the simulated world and use these maps for navigation tasks as well as to avoid obstacles during navigation. These methods can also be used to map real-world environments. Turtlebot3 acts as a Pursuer and the human model as an Evader.
