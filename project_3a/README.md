# Project 3a

The `pursuit_evasion_ws` folder is a catikin workspace with one package called 'pursuit_evasion'. That package is located in `pursuit_evasion_ws/src`. This package contains `launch` and `world` folders which contain roslaunch and gazebo .world files.

# Task 1
We've created `smallmaze.world` with gazebo for our robots to play around in.

## How to roslaunch `small_maze.launch`
`cd pursuit_evasion_ws`
`. devel/setup.bash`
`roslaunch pursuit_evasion small_maze.launch`
